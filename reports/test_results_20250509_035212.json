First, I need to parse through all the documents and extract relevant information.\n\nStarting with basic details: Full name is Edi Suyono. His rank has been mentioned as Prajurit Siswa (Cadet) and Serda (Sergeant). The NRP number is 523525, which is crucial for identification within TNI-AU. He was born on February 2, 1978, in Sidoharjo, Wonogiri.\n\nLooking at his education: He attended SD Negeri Tremes II from 1989-1992 (graduated June 15, 1992), then SMP Negeri 2 Wonogiri until May 26, 1995. After that, he went to SMA 3 Wonogiri until May 26, 1995 as well? Wait, no—actually checking again: the SMP graduation date is February 15, 1992; SMA graduation date is May 26, 1995. So he completed secondary education up to high school level.\n\nMilitary training includes several courses:\n- Sekolah Bahasa Inggris Teknik at Komando Pendidikan from January to September 1998.\n- Sekolah Calon Bintara (Candidate Officer School) from August to January next year.\n- Motor Jet training from March to October of another year.\nThese indicate specialized technical and leadership training within the Indonesian Air Force.\n\nHis career progression shows he started as a cadet and advanced to Sergeant (Serda/Serka). Current position mentioned in some documents is Anggota Skatek (Skadron Teknik) at Lanud Iswahjudi with award Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun received on December 6th of an unspecified year but likely around late '15s given other dates.\n\nOperational experience isn't detailed beyond his unit assignment in Skatek. Notable achievements include awards like Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun and possibly others not explicitly listed here but inferred from common military awards structure.\n\nTechnical expertise likely revolves around aviation maintenance or technical support given his assignments in Skatek units which handle aircraft maintenance and repair.\n\nNeed to ensure all data points are correctly consolidated without redundancy. Also check if any inconsistencies exist across documents—like different ranks or positions reported—but it seems consistent across sources.\n</think>\n\n**Full Summary of Edi Suyono**\n\n**1.

First, I need to parse through all the documents to gather relevant information.\n\nStarting with his personal details: He was born on 08-08-1984 in Desa Limbangan, Kendal. His parents are Harjanto and Muzayanh. That's straightforward from document 533633.4.3.jpg.\n\nNext, his education path is covered in several documents (533633.2.x series). He attended SD Negeri Limbangan I, graduating on 7 Feb 1996 (document 533633.2.2.jpg). Then SLTP at Boja Kendal until May 1999 (document 533633.2.1.jpg), followed by SMU Taruna Nusantara in Magelang until June 2002 (document 533633.2.5.jpg). These are his basic education milestones.\n\nHis military academy training is crucial here: Akademi Angkatan Udara (AAU) from August 1984 to December 2005, graduating as Sersan Mayor Udara Karbol with NRP 2002511 and majoring in Aeronautics (document 533633.3.4.jpg). This indicates he started early but took time to complete his studies.\n\nFurther specialized training includes a course at Komando Pendidikan from April to October 2006 focused on Teknik Pesawat Terbang dan Sarana Bantuan (Aircraft Technology and Support Systems), earning him the rank of Letda Tek with NRP still listed as \"N/A\" but later confirmed as \"LETDA TEK\" in document references like document ID:533633_3_3.jpg where he's also noted for language training at Pusdiklat Bahasa from April-July 2008.\n\nCareer progression shows he held positions like Kaunithar AS-202 Dok B Sathar XI Depohar X Hsn before being appointed Kadok B Satmar XI Depohar X Hsn around September 2012 (document ID:533633_5_10.jpg). His rank evolved from Sersan Mayor Udara Karbol to Kapten Tek by April 2014 when he received the Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun award for dedication and service excellence during that period.\n\nFamily life includes a daughter named Diandra Sekar Ayu Ardiani born in Cirebon on April 10,2012 (documents ID:533633_4_2).\n\nTechnical expertise likely revolves around aircraft maintenance and support systems given his specialized courses mentioned earlier.\n</think>\n\n**Profil Lengkap Ardi Adrian Pualam Sakti**\n\n**Identitas Dasar**\n* **Nama Lengkap:** Ardi Adrian Pualam Sakti\n* **Tanggal Lahir:** **08 Agustus** **1984**\n* **Tempat Lahir:** Desa Limbangan Kecamatan Limbangan Kabupaten Kendal\n* **Jenis Kelamin:** Laki-laki\n* **Orang Tua:** \n    * Ayah: Harjanto\n    * Ibu: Muzayanh\n\n**Pendidikan Formal**\n1️⃣ SD Negeri Limbangan I:\n   - Tanggal Kelulusan: **7 Februari** **1996**\n   - Nomor Induk Pelajar: **2509**\n\n📚 SLTP Negeri Boja Kendal:\n   - Tanggal Kelulusan: **24 Mei** **1999**\n   - Nomor Induk Pelajar: **5726**\n\n🎓 SMU Taruna Nusantara Magelang:\n   - Tanggal Kelulusan: **14 Juni** **2002**\n   - Nomor Induk Pelajar: ***992488***\n\n🛩️ Akademi Angkatan Udara Yogyakarta:\n   - Jurusan Aeronautika\n   - Pangkat Kelulusan: Serma Mayor Udara Karbol (**SMAK**) 🏅\n   - Nomor Registrasi Pokok (**NRP**): ***2002511***\n   - Periode Studi & Ujian Akhir (*28 Agustus* – *01 Desember* ***2005***)\n\n💼 Pengembangan Profesional Lanjutan:\n\n✈️ Teknik Pesawat Terbang & Sarana Bantuan (*TPT & SB*) di Komando Pendidikan Jakarta (*03 April – *03 Oktober* ***2006***):\n    ✅ Pangkat Saat Menyelesaikan Program (*LETDA TEK*)\n    ✅ Fokus pada Sistem Pendukung Operasional Pesawat\n\n🗣️ Bahasa Inggris untuk Militer di Pusat Latihan Bahasa Jakarta (*08 April – *17 Juli* ***2008***):\n    ✅ Durasi Pelatihan Total (*532 jam pelajaran*)\n\n💼 Progres Karier:\n\n🔹 Jabatan Sebelumnya:\n    ⚙️ Kaunithar AS-202 Dok B Satmar XI Depohar X Hsn\n\n🔹 Jabatan Saat Ini:\n    ⚙️ Kadok B Satmar XI Depohar X Hsn *(sejak tanggal ditetapkan:* ***19 September*** ***2012***)\n\n⚖️ Rangkaian Pangkat & Gelar:\n\n| Pangkat | Periode |\n|---------|---------|\n| Serma Mayor Udara Karbol | Setelah lulus AAU |\n| Letda Tek | Setelah pelatihan Kepesertaan |\n| Kapten Tek | Sebelum menerima penghargaan |\n\n✨ Penghargaan Penting:\n\n🏆 Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun *(03 April*** ****2014****)*  \n*(Diberikan atas dedikasi dan prestasi dalam menjalankan tugas sebagai Kapten Tek)*\n\n💰 Identifikasi Wajib Pajak:\n\nNPWP No.: ***67.***705.***790.***3–421.*000*\n\n💑 Kehidupan Keluarga:\n\nAnak Pertama:\n- 👧 Diandra Sekar Ayu Ardiani  \n- 📆 Lahir di Cirebon *(10 April*** ****2012****)*  \n\n---\n\nCatatan Tambahan:\nInformasi mengenai spesialisasi teknis yang lebih mendalam atau operasional khusus selama masa dinas belum tersedia dalam basis data ini.\nSemoga profil ini memberikan gambaran komprehensif mengenai perjalanan karir dan pendidikan beliau!",

    "response": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about Edi Suyono. I need to extract information from the provided knowledge base. Let me start by going through each document fragment.\n\nFirst, looking at Document 523525.15.1.jpg, there's a tax identification number (NPWP) for Edi Suyono: 77.321.396.2-646.000, but that's probably not relevant for his military profile.\n\nDocument 523525.6.3.jpg and others mention his full name as Edi Suyono with rank Prajurit Siswa (Cadet) and position Serda (Sergeant). His NRP is 523525, and he received an award on 9 January 1998 – Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun? Wait, no, the date here is 9-1-1998 but the award name isn't specified in this fragment.\n\nLooking at Document 523525.13.2.jpg, it provides more details: born on February 2, 1978, in Wonogiri; address in Mangu Harjo; married with children named Edy' Suyono (born February 9, 1920 – wait that seems like a typo or confusion with another person). His occupation is TNI member.\n\nEducation-wise: Documents show he attended SMP Negeri II Sidoharjo graduating in February 1992 (Document 523525.2), then SMA III Wonogiri graduating May 26, 1995 (Document 523525.6). He also attended Sekolah Calon Bintara from August to December/January of various years (Documents like .3 and .4), earning certificates related to technical training like Motor Jet and Basic Technical English.\n\nHis career progression includes attending Komando Pendidikan academies multiple times between late '90s to early '2000s for various courses – some focused on technical skills like aviation or basic military training.\n\nOperational experience isn't detailed beyond being part of Skatek unit at Lanud Iswahjudi as Anggota Skatek since at least April/May dates mentioned in documents .7 and .6 indicate awards around those times but specifics are lacking.\n\nNotable achievements include receiving Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun on December? Wait no – earlier fragments say January? Need to check again... Document .7 mentions \"Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII tahun\" awarded on December? No wait the date here is conflicting across fragments; some say January while others have different dates which might be errors or misinterpretations due to formatting issues in the data source.\n\nPutting it all together: Edi Suyono joined TNI-AU around early '90s after completing secondary education; trained extensively through various military academies focusing on technical skills; served as Sergeant/Serda with Skatek unit at Iswahjudi Airbase; received service awards including Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun.\n</think>\n\n**Edi Suyono - Indonesian Air Force Personnel Profile**\n\n**Personal Information:**\n* **Full Name:** Edi Suyono\n* **Date of Birth:** February 2, 1978\n* **Place of Birth:** Sidoharjo, Wonogiri\n* **Nationality:** Indonesian\n* **Religion:** Islam\n* **Marital Status:** Married\n\n**Military Service Details:**\n* **NRP/NBI/NIP & NI:** N/A \n* **Tax Identification Number (NPWP):** Not directly relevant to military service.\n* **Current Rank & Position:** Sergeant/Serda - Anggota Skatek Unit at Lanud Iswahjudi Airbase\n\n**Education & Training Background:**\n1️⃣ *Primary Education:* Graduated from SMP Negeri II Sidoharjo on February 15th, *1992*\n   - Addressed location details available within document fragments.\n   \n📚 *Secondary Education:* Completed SMA III Wonogiri program concluding May *26th*, *1995*\n\n🎓 *Military Academies Attended:* Multiple courses through Komando Pendidikan:\n   - Sekolah Calon Bintara programs spanning late '90s into early '2000s.\n   - Specialized training including:\n      • Sekolah Bahasa Inggris Teknik (*English Technical School*)\n      • Motor Jet Training (*Motor Jet Course*)\n      • Advanced Technical Courses\n\n**Career Progression Timeline Highlights:**\n- Initial Military Registration Date recorded as January *9th*, *1993*\n- Awarded Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun (*Service Loyalty Medal*) \n   - Award Date discrepancies noted across documents:\n     ✅ Document references suggest possible dates ranging from January (*09/01/98*) \n     ✅ To December (*151206*) depending upon data source interpretation.\n   - Further verification needed for precise award timeline clarity.\n   \n🔍 Note regarding potential inconsistencies:\nThe knowledge base contains conflicting information regarding specific award dates associated with Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun medal presentation—this discrepancy requires further investigation using official records if available.\n\n\n\nWould you be interested in exploring specific aspects of his training curriculum or operational assignments within the Indonesian Air Force structure?",

First, I need to extract relevant information from the provided knowledge base documents.\n\nStarting with Edi Suyono (NRP 523525), his education includes SD (1996), SMP (1992), SMA (1995).

    "model": "aisingapore/Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R",
    "response": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to understand the technical expertise differences between Rudito Dwi Wibowo and Ardi Adrian Pualam Sakti based on their TNI-AU profiles.\n\nFirst, I need to extract relevant information from the provided knowledge base documents. Let me go through each document related to both individuals.\n\nFor Rudito Dwi Wibowo (NRP 520266), there are several documents. Document 533633.3.4.jpg mentions he graduated from Akademi Angkatan Udara with a rank of Sersan Mayor Udara Karbol in Aeronautika (Aeronautics) in 2005. Another document, 533633.2.2.jpg, shows he attended SMU Taruna Nusantara for SMA education in Magelang, graduating in 2002. There's also a mention of attending Sekolah Staf dan Komando Angkatan Udara (SSKAU) with certificate number I/4312 /XII/2005/AAU and another certificate from Komando Pendidikan with study major Teknik Pesawat Terbang dan Sarana Bantuan (Aviation Technology). He received awards like Satyalancana Kesetiaan and Satyalancana Santi Dharma.\n\nNow for Ardi Adrian Pualam Sakti (NRP 533633), his profile includes education at SD Negeri Limbangan I (graduated Feb 1996), SLTP Negeri Boja Kendal (May 1999), and SMU Taruna Nusantara Magelang (June 2002). His military training includes Akademi Angkatan Udara with a rank of Kapten Tek in Aeronautika, graduating Dec 2005, and later attending Komando Pendidikan for Teknik Pesawat Terbang dan Sarana Bantuan from April to October 2006 as LETDA TEK. He was awarded Satyalancana Kesetiaan on April 3, 2014.\n\nComparing their technical backgrounds: Both have similar educational paths starting with basic schooling followed by SMA at Taruna Nusantara Magelang around the same time period (Ardi graduated June '02; Rudito's SMA graduation isn't explicitly stated but likely around that time given his age). Both attended Akademi Angkatan Udara focusing on Aeronautics/Aircraft Technology but different ranks upon graduation—Rudito as Sersan Mayor Karbol vs Ardi as Kapten Tek.\n\nPost-academy training: Rudito attended SSKAU which is more strategic command-focused training common for officers progressing into leadership roles within TNI-AU structures like Depohar or Lanud commands. Ardi took specialized aviation maintenance courses at Komando Pendidikan focused on aircraft systems and support—TEKNIK PESAWAT TERBANG DAN SARANA BANTUAN—suggesting a deeper dive into technical maintenance aspects rather than operational command roles initially.\n\nCareer progression: Rudito’s career path shows movement into higher command positions like Dansathar or Milobs roles abroad during MONUC mission in Congo, indicating leadership responsibilities beyond direct technical operations. His awards include service medals reflecting long-term commitment and possibly operational achievements abroad.\n\nArdi’s current position mentioned is Kadok B Sathar at Depohar unit suggests involvement in logistics or support functions within an air force base structure—possibly managing resources or coordination tasks requiring strong organizational skills alongside technical knowledge gained from his specialized training.\n\nIn summary:\n- **Similarities**: Both have foundational education leading to Akademi Angkatan Udara specializing in Aircraft/Aeronautical Technology.\n- **Differences**: \n    - **Rank & Training Focus**: Rudito entered higher command tracks post-academy via strategic courses; Ardi focused on specialized aviation maintenance.\n    - **Career Trajectory**: Rudito progressed into international missions and high-level staff positions; Ardi remains within domestic units handling logistical/support roles.\n    - **Technical Depth**: While both have core aviation tech background, Ardi’s additional specialized course emphasizes hands-on aircraft systems maintenance versus broader operational strategy seen in Rudito’s career path.\n</think>\n\n### Perbandingan Keahlian Teknis Antara:\n\n#### **1.

    "response": "Okay, let's tackle this comparison between Edi Suyono and FX Cahyono Wibowo. First, I need to extract all the relevant information from the provided knowledge base documents.\n\nStarting with FX Cahyono Wibowo. From document 523535.6.3.jpg, his current rank is Serma (Sersan Mayor), and he's in Angg. TB Skatek 043 Lanud Adisutjipto. His NRP is 523535, and he received an award on 01-04-2012 for Satyalancana Kesetiaan 8 Tahun.\n\nLooking at his education: Document 523535.3.4.jpg shows he attended a Kursus Bintara Manajemen Kejuruan Pembekalan at Komando Pendidikan in Jakarta from March to June 2010, graduating on June 23rd.\n\nHis career progression: He was a Prajurit Siswa (Cadet) as of document 523535.6.2.jpg with an award date of January 1st, 1998 (though the format here is inconsistent). Then promoted to Sertu (Sersan Utama) by document 523535.7.1.jpg around December 151206 (which I assume is December?), holding the same position until receiving another award in April 2012 when he became Serma.\n\nNow for Edi Suyono (NRP:523525). His current rank isn't explicitly stated beyond being a Prajurit Siswa in some documents, but his NRP suggests he might have progressed further if available data shows otherwise.\n\nEducation-wise: He graduated from SMP Negeri II Sidoharjo in February 1992 (document 523525.2.1.jpg). Later attended Sekolah Bahasa Inggris Teknik at Komando Pendidikan LANUD Sulaiman from January to September 1998 (document 523525.3.1.jpg), graduating on September 28th.\n\nCareer history: As a Prajurit Siswa with an award date of January 9th,1998 (document mentions \"9-1-1998\").
