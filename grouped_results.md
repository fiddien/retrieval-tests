## Query ID: ardi_summary
**Query:** Give a full summary of Ardi Adrian Pualam Sakti

### **Model:** aisingapore/Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R
Okay, let's start by gathering all the information about Ardi Adrian Pualam Sakti from the provided knowledge base. First, I need to check each document fragment to see what details are available.

Looking at Document 533633.4.3.jpg, it mentions his full name as ARDI ARDIAN PUALAM SAKTI and his rank as Sersan Mayor Udara Karbol (Wing Commander). His NRP is 2002511, and he graduated from Akademi Angkatan Udara with a major in Aeronautics on December 3, 2005.

Next, Document 533633.2.5.jpg shows he attended SMU Taruna Nusantara in Magelang and graduated on June 14, 2002. Then Document 533633.2.1.jpg indicates he completed SLTP at Sekolah Lanjutan Tingkat Pertama (SLTP) Negeri 1 Boja in Kendal on May 24, 1999.

Document 533633.7.1.jpg lists his current position as Kadok B Satmar (Commander of Logistics) at Satmar-11 Depohar-10 with the rank of Kapten Tek (Captain Technical), awarded the Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun on April 3, 2014.

Document 533633.5.10.jpg mentions a previous position as Kaunithar AS-202 Dok B before being appointed to his current role on September 19, 2012.

There's also information about his family: born August 28,1984 in Kendal to Harjanto and Muzayananah (Documents like .4 and .15). He has a daughter named Diandra Sekar Ayu Ardiani born April10,2012 in Cirebon (Document .4).

I need to structure this into sections: Personal Details, Education & Training, Career Progression & Positions Held including operational roles if any are mentioned but here it seems more administrative/logistical roles are highlighted rather than combat missions.

Technical Expertise would include Aeronautics from Akademi Angkatan Udara and Teknik Pesawat Terbang dan Sarana Bantuan from Komando Pendidikan training.

## Query ID: edi_summary
**Query:** Give a full summary of Edi Suyono

### **Model:** aisingapore/Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R
Okay, let's tackle this query about Edi Suyono. The user wants a full summary based on the provided knowledge base. First, I need to parse through all the documents and extract relevant information.

Starting with basic details: Full name is Edi Suyono. His rank has been mentioned as Prajurit Siswa (Cadet) and Serda (Sergeant). The NRP number is 523525, which is crucial for identification within TNI-AU. He was born on February 2, 1978, in Sidoharjo, Wonogiri.

Looking at his education: He attended SD Negeri Tremes II from 1989-1992 (graduated June 15, 1992), then SMP Negeri 2 Wonogiri until May 26, 1995. After that, he went to SMA 3 Wonogiri until May 26, 1995 as well? Wait, no—actually checking again: the SMP graduation date is February 15, 1992; SMA graduation date is May 26, 1995. So he completed secondary education up to high school level.

Military training includes several courses:
- Sekolah Bahasa Inggris Teknik at Komando Pendidikan from January to September 1998.
- Sekolah Calon Bintara (Candidate Officer School) from August to January next year.
- Motor Jet training from March to October of another year.
These indicate specialized technical and leadership training within the Indonesian Air Force.

His career progression shows he started as a cadet and advanced to Sergeant (Serda/Serka). Current position mentioned in some documents is Anggota Skatek (Skadron Teknik) at Lanud Iswahjudi with award Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun received on December 6th of an unspecified year but likely around late '15s given other dates.

Operational experience isn't detailed beyond his unit assignment in Skatek. Notable achievements include awards like Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun and possibly others not explicitly listed here but inferred from common military awards structure.

Technical expertise likely revolves around aviation maintenance or technical support given his assignments in Skatek units which handle aircraft maintenance and repair.

Need to ensure all data points are correctly consolidated without redundancy. Also check if any inconsistencies exist across documents—like different ranks or positions reported—but it seems consistent across sources.

Okay, the user is asking for a full summary of Amin Rahardjo. Let me check the provided knowledge base first. The documents available are about Syarifudin, not Amin Rahardjo. Both entries mention Madrasah Ibtidaiyah Al-Amin Dempelan Madiun and similar details like birth date and graduation date.

Since there's no information on Amin Rahardjo in the given data, I need to inform the user that the requested profile isn't available. It's important to be clear and direct about this limitation without making assumptions or providing incorrect details. The user might have confused names or there might be a typo, but based on what's here, there's nothing to summarize for Amin Rahardjo.

## Query ID: rudito_summary
**Query:** Give me a full summary of Rudito Dwi Wibowo

### **Model:** aisingapore/Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R
Okay, let's start by gathering all the information about Rudito Dwi Wibowo from the provided knowledge base. First, I need to check each document fragment to extract relevant details.

From Document 520266.15.1.jpg and 520266.5.6.jpg, I see his full name is Rudito Dwi Wibowo and his rank is Letnan Dua (Second Lieutenant). His NRP is 520266, and he received an award on July 27, 1995.

Looking at Document 520266.3.4.jpg and 520266.3.1.jpg, there are mentions of him attending the Sekolah Staf dan Komando Angkatan Udara (SSKAU) in Lembang on November 4, 2010, with a certificate number starting with "6083/SEKKAU/76/2004". However, this seems conflicting with another document where he attended Akademi TNI Angkatan Udara in Yogyakarta on July 17, 1995 (Document 520266.3.2.jpg), graduating as Marsekal Muda TNI (Major General) with a major in Aeronautika.

His education includes SMA graduation in Ciputat on June 12, 1992 (Document 520266.2.6.jpg), SMP graduation in Ciputat on June 8, 1989 (Document 520266.2.1.jpg), and SD graduation in Legoso on February 4, born March 6th.

Operational experience includes being a Milobs during the MONUC mission in Congo around December-December-2007 where he received Satyalancana Santi Dharma (Document:7). He also served as Kasi KT-1B/T-34C Disaeroau at Lanud Adi since April-July? Wait no dates are clear here but awards include Satyalancana Kesetiaan IV April-July? Not sure about exact dates but multiple awards listed.

He has two children: Rasdy Prima Arief Wibowo born June24th1990 and Delvin Pradipta Wibowo born December02nd2003 according to Documents:4 &12.

Family details show he's married to Wahyu Inggit Pertwi since March17th2000 per Document8.

## Query ID: ardi_id_summary
**Query:** Jelaskan secara detail tentang Ardi Adrian Pualam Sakti

### **Model:** aisingapore/Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R
Okay, let's tackle this query about Ardi Adrian Pualam Sakti. The user wants a detailed explanation based on the provided knowledge base. First, I need to parse through all the documents to gather relevant information.

Starting with his personal details: He was born on 08-08-1984 in Desa Limbangan, Kendal. His parents are Harjanto and Muzayanh. That's straightforward from document 533633.4.3.jpg.

Next, his education path is covered in several documents (533633.2.x series). He attended SD Negeri Limbangan I, graduating on 7 Feb 1996 (document 533633.2.2.jpg). Then SLTP at Boja Kendal until May 1999 (document 533633.2.1.jpg), followed by SMU Taruna Nusantara in Magelang until June 2002 (document 533633.2.5.jpg). These are his basic education milestones.

His military academy training is crucial here: Akademi Angkatan Udara (AAU) from August 1984 to December 2005, graduating as Sersan Mayor Udara Karbol with NRP 2002511 and majoring in Aeronautics (document 533633.3.4.jpg). This indicates he started early but took time to complete his studies.

Further specialized training includes a course at Komando Pendidikan from April to October 2006 focused on Teknik Pesawat Terbang dan Sarana Bantuan (Aircraft Technology and Support Systems), earning him the rank of Letda Tek with NRP still listed as "N/A" but later confirmed as "LETDA TEK" in document references like document ID:533633_3_3.jpg where he's also noted for language training at Pusdiklat Bahasa from April-July 2008.

Career progression shows he held positions like Kaunithar AS-202 Dok B Sathar XI Depohar X Hsn before being appointed Kadok B Satmar XI Depohar X Hsn around September 2012 (document ID:533633_5_10.jpg). His rank evolved from Sersan Mayor Udara Karbol to Kapten Tek by April 2014 when he received the Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun award for dedication and service excellence during that period.

Family life includes a daughter named Diandra Sekar Ayu Ardiani born in Cirebon on April 10,2012 (documents ID:533633_4_2).

Technical expertise likely revolves around aircraft maintenance and support systems given his specialized courses mentioned earlier.

## Query ID: edi_alt_summary
**Query:** What can you tell me about Edi Suyono?

### **Model:** aisingapore/Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about Edi Suyono. I need to extract information from the provided knowledge base. Let me start by going through each document fragment.

First, looking at Document 523525.15.1.jpg, there's a tax identification number (NPWP) for Edi Suyono: 77.321.396.2-646.000, but that's probably not relevant for his military profile.

Document 523525.6.3.jpg and others mention his full name as Edi Suyono with rank Prajurit Siswa (Cadet) and position Serda (Sergeant). His NRP is 523525, and he received an award on 9 January 1998 – Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun? Wait, no, the date here is 9-1-1998 but the award name isn't specified in this fragment.

Looking at Document 523525.13.2.jpg, it provides more details: born on February 2, 1978, in Wonogiri; address in Mangu Harjo; married with children named Edy' Suyono (born February 9, 1920 – wait that seems like a typo or confusion with another person). His occupation is TNI member.

Education-wise: Documents show he attended SMP Negeri II Sidoharjo graduating in February 1992 (Document 523525.2), then SMA III Wonogiri graduating May 26, 1995 (Document 523525.6). He also attended Sekolah Calon Bintara from August to December/January of various years (Documents like .3 and .4), earning certificates related to technical training like Motor Jet and Basic Technical English.

His career progression includes attending Komando Pendidikan academies multiple times between late '90s to early '2000s for various courses – some focused on technical skills like aviation or basic military training.

Operational experience isn't detailed beyond being part of Skatek unit at Lanud Iswahjudi as Anggota Skatek since at least April/May dates mentioned in documents .7 and .6 indicate awards around those times but specifics are lacking.

Notable achievements include receiving Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun on December? Wait no – earlier fragments say January? Need to check again... Document .7 mentions "Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII tahun" awarded on December? No wait the date here is conflicting across fragments; some say January while others have different dates which might be errors or misinterpretations due to formatting issues in the data source.

Putting it all together: Edi Suyono joined TNI-AU around early '90s after completing secondary education; trained extensively through various military academies focusing on technical skills; served as Sergeant/Serda with Skatek unit at Iswahjudi Airbase; received service awards including Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun.

### **Model:** aisingapore/Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know the differences and similarities between Edi Suyono and Amin Rahardjo based on the provided knowledge base.

First, I need to check if both individuals are present in the data. Looking through the documents, there are multiple entries for Edi Suyono with details like NRP 523525, rank progression from Prajurit Siswa to Serda, education at various schools including SMA 3 Wonogiri and Sekolah Dasar Kejuruan Teknik, and awards like Satyalancana Kesetiaan 8 Tahun. However, there's no mention of Amin Rahardjo in any of the provided documents. 

Since Amin Rahardjo isn't listed in the knowledge base fragments provided, I can't extract any information about him. Therefore, comparing them directly isn't possible without additional data on Amin Rahardjo.

The user might have intended to ask about two different personnel within TNI-AU records but only one is documented here. Alternatively, they might be testing if I can handle missing information gracefully.

In either case, my response should clearly state that only Edi Suyono's profile is available and that a comparison with Amin Rahardjo isn't feasible due to lack of data on him.

### **Model:** aisingapore/Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R
Okay, let's tackle this comparison between Edi Suyono and Ardi Ardian Pualam Sakti based on their professional backgrounds. First, I need to extract relevant information from the provided knowledge base documents.

Starting with Edi Suyono (NRP 523525), his education includes SD (1996), SMP (1992), SMA (1995). He attended a Bahasa Inggris Teknik course at Komando Pendidikan in 1998. His military career began as a Prajurit Siswa in 1993, promoted to Serda by 1998. He received the SATYALANCANA KESETIAAN award in 2014 while holding the position of Kapten Tek at Kadok B Sathar 11 Depohar 10 Hsn.

Now for Ardi Ardian Pualam Sakti (NRP 533633), his education includes SLTP (1999), SMU Taruna Nusantara (2002), and Akademi Angkatan Udara where he graduated as Lettu Tek in December 2005. He completed additional training at Komando Pendidikan for Teknik Pesawat Terbang dan Sarana Bantuan from April to October 2006 and another course at Pusat Pendidikan dan Pelatihan Bahasa from April to July 2008. His military positions include being appointed Kaunithar AS-202 Dok B Sathar 11 Depohar 10 Hsn before becoming Ka Dok B same unit on September 19, 2012.

Comparing their experience: Both have similar entry points into military service around the late '90s/early '00s. However, Ardi has more specialized training through Akademi Angkatan Udara and advanced courses, indicating deeper technical expertise in aviation-related fields. Edi's experience is more general with language training and administrative roles like Serda and later Kapten Tek positions.

Ardi's promotions seem more focused on technical roles within aviation units, while Edi's progression includes both operational roles as Serda and higher administrative ranks like Kapten Tek overseeing documentation units.

Considering specialization versus breadth of experience: Ardi’s background suggests greater depth in aviation-specific skills due to his academy training and subsequent specialized courses. Edi’s experience is broader but less specialized technically.

TB Skatek 043 Lanud Adisutjipto), and awards like Satyalancana Kesetiaan 8 Tahun. However, there's no mention of Amin Rahardjo at all in any of the provided documents.

Since Amin Rahardjo isn't listed in the knowledge base, I can't compare their leadership records directly. The available information only covers FX Cahyono Wibowo's career path up to his position as Anggota Skatek 043 Lanud Adisutjipto with a promotion from Sertu to Serma around April 2012. He also received an award for loyalty service.

Given that there's no data on Amin Rahardjo, it's impossible to make a fair comparison. The answer should clearly state that only FX Cahyono Wibowo's profile is available and that without information on Amin Rahardjo, a comparison isn't possible.

## Query ID: technical_skills_compare
**Query:** I need to understand the technical expertise difference between Rudito Dwi Wibowo and Ardi Adrian Pualam Sakti. Can you analyze their technical backgrounds?

### **Model:** aisingapore/Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to understand the technical expertise differences between Rudito Dwi Wibowo and Ardi Adrian Pualam Sakti based on their TNI-AU profiles.

First, I need to extract relevant information from the provided knowledge base documents. Let me go through each document related to both individuals.

For Rudito Dwi Wibowo (NRP 520266), there are several documents. Document 533633.3.4.jpg mentions he graduated from Akademi Angkatan Udara with a rank of Sersan Mayor Udara Karbol in Aeronautika (Aeronautics) in 2005. Another document, 533633.2.2.jpg, shows he attended SMU Taruna Nusantara for SMA education in Magelang, graduating in 2002. There's also a mention of attending Sekolah Staf dan Komando Angkatan Udara (SSKAU) with certificate number I/4312 /XII/2005/AAU and another certificate from Komando Pendidikan with study major Teknik Pesawat Terbang dan Sarana Bantuan (Aviation Technology). He received awards like Satyalancana Kesetiaan and Satyalancana Santi Dharma.

Now for Ardi Adrian Pualam Sakti (NRP 533633), his profile includes education at SD Negeri Limbangan I (graduated Feb 1996), SLTP Negeri Boja Kendal (May 1999), and SMU Taruna Nusantara Magelang (June 2002). His military training includes Akademi Angkatan Udara with a rank of Kapten Tek in Aeronautika, graduating Dec 2005, and later attending Komando Pendidikan for Teknik Pesawat Terbang dan Sarana Bantuan from April to October 2006 as LETDA TEK. He was awarded Satyalancana Kesetiaan on April 3, 2014.

Comparing their technical backgrounds: Both have similar educational paths starting with basic schooling followed by SMA at Taruna Nusantara Magelang around the same time period (Ardi graduated June '02; Rudito's SMA graduation isn't explicitly stated but likely around that time given his age). Both attended Akademi Angkatan Udara focusing on Aeronautics/Aircraft Technology but different ranks upon graduation—Rudito as Sersan Mayor Karbol vs Ardi as Kapten Tek.

Post-academy training: Rudito attended SSKAU which is more strategic command-focused training common for officers progressing into leadership roles within TNI-AU structures like Depohar or Lanud commands. Ardi took specialized aviation maintenance courses at Komando Pendidikan focused on aircraft systems and support—TEKNIK PESAWAT TERBANG DAN SARANA BANTUAN—suggesting a deeper dive into technical maintenance aspects rather than operational command roles initially.

Career progression: Rudito’s career path shows movement into higher command positions like Dansathar or Milobs roles abroad during MONUC mission in Congo, indicating leadership responsibilities beyond direct technical operations. His awards include service medals reflecting long-term commitment and possibly operational achievements abroad.

Ardi’s current position mentioned is Kadok B Sathar at Depohar unit suggests involvement in logistics or support functions within an air force base structure—possibly managing resources or coordination tasks requiring strong organizational skills alongside technical knowledge gained from his specialized training.

In summary:
- **Similarities**: Both have foundational education leading to Akademi Angkatan Udara specializing in Aircraft/Aeronautical Technology.
- **Differences**: 
    - **Rank & Training Focus**: Rudito entered higher command tracks post-academy via strategic courses; Ardi focused on specialized aviation maintenance.
    - **Career Trajectory**: Rudito progressed into international missions and high-level staff positions; Ardi remains within domestic units handling logistical/support roles.
    - **Technical Depth**: While both have core aviation tech background, Ardi’s additional specialized course emphasizes hands-on aircraft systems maintenance versus broader operational strategy seen in Rudito’s career path.

## Query ID: career_progression_compare
**Query:** Tolong analisa dan bandingkan perkembangan karir dari Edi Suyono dan FX Cahyono Wibowo dari awal hingga posisi terakhir mereka

### **Model:** aisingapore/Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R
Okay, let's tackle this comparison between Edi Suyono and FX Cahyono Wibowo. First, I need to extract all the relevant information from the provided knowledge base documents.

Starting with FX Cahyono Wibowo. From document 523535.6.3.jpg, his current rank is Serma (Sersan Mayor), and he's in Angg. TB Skatek 043 Lanud Adisutjipto. His NRP is 523535, and he received an award on 01-04-2012 for Satyalancana Kesetiaan 8 Tahun.

Looking at his education: Document 523535.3.4.jpg shows he attended a Kursus Bintara Manajemen Kejuruan Pembekalan at Komando Pendidikan in Jakarta from March to June 2010, graduating on June 23rd.

His career progression: He was a Prajurit Siswa (Cadet) as of document 523535.6.2.jpg with an award date of January 1st, 1998 (though the format here is inconsistent). Then promoted to Sertu (Sersan Utama) by document 523535.7.1.jpg around December 151206 (which I assume is December?), holding the same position until receiving another award in April 2012 when he became Serma.

Now for Edi Suyono (NRP:523525). His current rank isn't explicitly stated beyond being a Prajurit Siswa in some documents, but his NRP suggests he might have progressed further if available data shows otherwise.

Education-wise: He graduated from SMP Negeri II Sidoharjo in February 1992 (document 523525.2.1.jpg). Later attended Sekolah Bahasa Inggris Teknik at Komando Pendidikan LANUD Sulaiman from January to September 1998 (document 523525.3.1.jpg), graduating on September 28th.

Career history: As a Prajurit Siswa with an award date of January 9th,1998 (document mentions "9-1-1998"). No further promotions are listed in the provided data beyond that initial entry.

Comparing both:

FX has more detailed career progression—starting as Cadet/Serda then moving up to Sertu and finally Serma over time with specific training courses and awards like Satyalancana Kesetiaan VIII Tahun which indicates long service commitment.

Edi’s records show earlier education milestones but limited career progression details post-Prajurit Siswa stage; no later ranks or positions are documented here.
